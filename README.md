Horiseon focuses on SEO and lead generation.  Their webiste highlights the three areas they focus on most.
I was able to look at the code they had in place for their site, and refactor it.
The first change I made was making sure the header was added and then made sure the navigation bar was specified within the header. I also added an aside for all the content on the right of the page.  The three links that are in the navigation bar should take you to the specific sections within the main content.  Not all the links were working, but now all three links work and will get you to the correct section when clicked.
<br><br>
I had some challenges when I was consolidating the CSS code, but was able to work through understanding what was breaking and why.  For example, when I added the the navigation bar, I did not initially update the style sheet from **.header div** to **.header nav**
