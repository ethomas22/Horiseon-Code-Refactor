# Horiseon Code Refactor
## Description
Horiseon focuses on SEO and lead generation.  Their webiste highlights the three areas they focus on most.
I was able to look at the code they had in place for their site, and refactor it.
The first change I made was making sure the header was added and then made sure the navigation bar was specified within the header.
The three links that are in the navigation bar should take you to the specific sections within the main content.  Not all the links were working, but now all three links work and will get you to the correct section when clicked.
Below is an image of the three sections within the main content.
